# Philosophers  

**Philosophers** is a 42 project that explores concurrency, process synchronization, and the challenges of avoiding race conditions and deadlocks. It is based on the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, where multiple philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping while competing for limited resources (forks). This project enhances understanding of multithreading, mutexes, and semaphores, providing essential knowledge for parallel programming and system-level development.
